abstract = {In this review, we discuss the main problems and state-of-the-art solutions applied to the field of gene expression. Specific data analysis workflows have been developed in parallel with the technology and currently cover a very wide spectrum of methods and applications needed to give answers to a lot of scientific questions that this type of data are producing. Computer science and,more specifically, the data mining area is still benefiting from a large set of real-case scenarios to apply and develop new ideas and tools for discovering biological knowledge and new information from this experimental data. In this article, we make the reader aware of the main problems that still persist and provide a description of the methodologies that are applied for classification, clustering, and functional exploration of gene expression data. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

@article{Lawler1999,
abstract = {Molecular Medicine and Molecular Pathology are integral parts of Haematology as we enter the new millennium. Their origins can be linked to fundamental developments in the basic sciences, particularly genetics, chemistry and biochemistry. The structure of DNA and the genetic code that it encrypts are the critical starting points to our understanding of these new disciplines. The genetic alphabet is a simple one, consisting of just 4 letters, buts its influence is crucial to human development and differentiation. The concept of a gene is not a new one but the Human Genome Project (a joint world-wide effort to characterise our entire genetic make-up) is providing an invaluable understanding of how genes function in normal cellular processes and pinpointing how disruption of these processes can lead to disease. Transcription and translation are the key events by which our genotype is converted to our phenotype (via a messenger RNA intermediate), producing the myriad proteins and enzymes which populate the cellular factory of our body. Unlike the bacterial or prokaryotic genome, the human genome contains a large amount of non coding DNA (less than 1% of our genome codes for proteins), and our genes are interrupted, with the coding regions or exons separated by non coding introns. Precise removal of the intronic material after transcription (though a process called splicing) is critical for efficient translation to occur. Incorrect splicing can lead to the generation of mutant proteins, which can have a dilaterious effect on the phenotype of the individual. Thus the 100,000-200,000 genes which are present in each cell in our body have a defined control mechanism permitting efficient and appropriate expression of proteins and enzymes and yet a single base change in just one of those genes can lead to diseases such as haemophilia or fanconis anaemia.},

@article{Carnesecchi2018,
abstract = {Hox transcription factors (TFs) function as key determinants in the specification of cell fates during development. They do so by triggering entire morphogenetic cascades through the activation of specific target genes. In contrast to their fundamental role in development, the molecular mechanisms employed by Hox TFs are still poorly understood. In recent years, a new picture has emerged regarding the function of Hox proteins in gene regulation. Initial studies have primarily focused on understanding how Hox TFs recognize and bind specific enhancers to activate defined Hox targets. However, genome-wide studies on the interactions and dynamics of Hox proteins have revealed a more elaborate function of the Hox factors. It is now known that Hox proteins are involved in several steps of gene expression with potential regulatory functions in the modification of the chromatin landscape and its accessibility, recognition and activation of specific cis-regulatory modules, assembly and activation of promoter transcription complexes and mRNA processing. In the coming years, the characterization of the molecular activity of Hox TFs in these mechanisms will greatly contribute to our general understanding of Hox activity.},
